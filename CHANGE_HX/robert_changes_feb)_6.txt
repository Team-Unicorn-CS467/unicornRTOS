- board_io.c:
	-removed references to register abstractions that reference lm4f120h5qr.h
	    - spent an unreasonable amount of time trying to do this making use of 
			
			SystemCoreClockUpdate();
			SysTick_Config(SystemCoreClock / BSP_TICKS_PER_SEC);
	
			but after many hours I just couldn't get it to work.  
			I replaced it with references to TM4C123GH6PM reg. abstractions
		
		- couldn't find a TM4C123GH6PM.h reg. abstraction for NVIC_SYS_PRI3_R,
		  so I just hardcoded the same memory address
		  
    - removed masks.h and moved some of the #define values over to board_io.h
	    (some of the references in masks.h were circular/unnecessary)
		
    - setup is defunct, as we're including IAR project files now
