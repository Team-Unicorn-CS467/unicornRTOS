files changes:
	- make copy of 'qpc' directory in $PROJ_DIR$ folder
    - remove copy of CMSIS folder at  $PROJ_DIR$ level (it's included as part of qpc in preprocessor)
	
IAR project C/C++ compiler preprocessor include changes:
	$PROJ_DIR$\qpc\3rd_party\CMSIS\Include  (all the links from TM4c123GH6PM.h to core_cm4.h etc)
	$PROJ_DIR$\qpc\include   				(#include "qassert.h"")
	$PROJ_DIR$\qpc\3rd_party\ek-tm4c123gxl	(I added a group in the project view, see below)

board_io.c:
	- added ledRedOn / ledRedOff (blue, green) for testing purposes
	
	boardStartup()
	- added:
	   - NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, 0U);   (CMSIS function to set SysTick interrupt priority)
			to set Systick priority to highest
			default is to have it set to lowest and upon being equal
			priority with PendSV it doesn't get interrupted ???)
	   
unicorn.c/unicorn.h
	- added 'volatile' keyword to currentTask, nextTask as they are inside
	  interrupts and Miro said that was a good idea (can't hurt)
	  
	- #include qassert.h, which requires "Q_DEFINE_THIS_FILE" macro and Q_onAssert() function
	
	- 'readyNewTask()' 
	    - added Q_ASSERT(i < MAX_TASKS) // so program crashes and reboots if too many tasks are initialized
		
	- Q_onAssert() // added at end to handle Q_ASSERT() call earlier
	    -- calls CMSIS 'NVIC_SystemReset();
