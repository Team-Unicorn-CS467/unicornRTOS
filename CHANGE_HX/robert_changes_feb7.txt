IAR project C/C++ compiler preprocessor include changes:
	$PROJ_DIR$\CMSIS\Include 				(already there)
	$PROJ_DIR$\qpc\include   				(#include "qassert.h"")
	$PROJ_DIR$\qpc\3rd_party\ek-tm4c123gxl	


boat_io.c:
	- added ledRedOn / ledRedOff (blue, green) for testing purposes
	
	boardStartup()
	- added:
	   NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, 0U); 
	   to set Systick priority to highest
	   (default is to have it set to lowest and upon being equal
	   priority with PendSV it doesn't get interrupted)
	   
unicorn.c/unicorn.h
	- added 'volatile' keyword to currentTask, nextTask as they are inside
	  interrupts and Miro said that was a good idea (can't hurt)
	  
	- #include qassert.h, which requires "Q_DEFINE_THIS_FILE" macro and Q_onAssert() function
