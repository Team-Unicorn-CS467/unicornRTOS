startup_vector_table.c	
	handler_PendSV()
		-added a branch so idleTask does not push it's
		contents upon context switch (for faster switching)
		
unicorn.c
	onIdle()
		- changed while(1) to for(;;) because i've never written
		it in code and i think it looks cool
	
	initializeScheduler()
		- added idleTask TBC back to taskTable; refactored the function
		
sched()
	- simplified the scheduling algo with a bit mask to check
	ready tasks
	- moved assert of INTCTRL reg (trigger PendSV) to sched()
	also moved the check on 'if (currentTask = nextTask)' and
	created a temporary variable because the compiler was squawking
	about comparing two volatile variables (see note in code)
